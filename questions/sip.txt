- question: Which key fact is wrong?
  answers:
    - Using a patch cord to interconnect two terminations is called a 'context'.
    - The operator represents a 'softswitch'
    - The protocol used for an operator to speak to another operator would be
      SS7 or now, SIP.
    - The patch panel directly compares with a VoIP media gateway.
  day: 2
- question: Which key fact is WRONG?
  answers:
    - Legacy service requires signaling and media to follow parallel path.
    - SS7 is to SIP as bearer channels are to RTP.
    - A Circuit switch must process both signaling and media.
    - A SIP B2BUA must process both SIP and the media.

  answers:
    - Identified by a packet containing the word 'reINVITE'
    - A SIP 'INVITE' that occurs within an established dialog
    - Usually contained within the RTP stream
    - Often used to modify the media
  day: 4
- question: What is true of a 'PRACK'?
  answers:
    - Used to add reliability to provisional responses
    - If a PRACK is used with a 180, then the dialog begins with the 180.
    - Stands for 'Partial Acknowledgment'
    - Can cause more problems than it solves!
  day: 4
- question: What is true regarding early dialog?
  answers:
    - A UA enters early dialog based on information in a provisional response.
    - There can be many early dialogs prior to the final dialog.
    - An early dialog ends with a 199.
    - Often a result of SIP forking.
